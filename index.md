I'm Austin, a recent CSE graduate of the University of Michigan in the Class of 2020. This summer I will be starting as a software engineer FTE at Facebook. You can check out my CV [here](https://riopelle.me/files/austin_riopelle_resume.pdf).

My personal interests include 3D computer vision topics and research in addition to hobbyist game development, with an eye towards art and graphics. I have listed my projects together on this site as well.
