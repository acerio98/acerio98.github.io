I'm Austin, a recent CSE graduate of the University of Michigan in the Class of 2020. This summer I will be starting as a software engineer FTE at Facebook. I am interested in research in computer vision and human-computer interaction, especially as applied to 3D vision topics. You can check out my CV [here](https://riopelle.me/files/austin_riopelle_resume.pdf).

On the side I also engage in hobbyist game development, with an eye towards art and graphics, and have listed my projects together on this site as well.
