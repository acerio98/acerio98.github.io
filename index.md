I'm Austin, a senior studying computer science at the University of Michigan. I am interested in research in computer vision and human-computer interaction, especially as applied to 3D vision topics. You can check out my CV [here](https://riopelle.me/files/austin_riopelle_resume.pdf), and learn more about my research using the menu button.

On the side I also engage in hobbyist game development, with an eye towards art and graphics, and have listed my projects together on this site as well.
