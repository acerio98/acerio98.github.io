I enjoy game development and have experience in multiple disciplines, including programming, 3D and 2D art, and even a little bit of music creation. However, I am most specialized in coding in Unity using C# and 3D modeling in Blender. Nearly all of the 3D models and textures in the games below were created by me. Recently I have also begun to dabble in shader programming, and hope to explore more in this area.

# Sunset Island
A survival horror game I made with a 6-person group in October 2018 for a game jam. Look around the town, collect resources, and watch out for the spiders!
#Bad things will happen at night if you are not careful.  

#You will need to be fast and chop down trees and pick up rocks before the sunsets. But if night falls, make good use of the tools you have collected to protect yourself and survive as long as possible. You can do it!
