I enjoy game development and have experience in multiple disciplines, including programming, 3D and 2D art, and even (a little bit of) music creation. However, I am most interested and specialized in graphics programming and 3D modeling (using Blender). Nearly all of the 3D models and textures in the games below, with the exception of Io, were created by me.

# Io
Io is a single-player 2D platformer I created as part of a 50+ person team run by the WolverineSoft game development student organization at the University of Michigan in the Winter 2020 semester. On the project I acted as a lead for the VFX pod where I managed sprints and contributed to development of particles and shaders for player, environment, enemy, and boss effects. The 3-month project ran from February through April and the final game was presented at the UMich EECS 494 Video Game Showcase and the Student Games Festival organized by [SGDA](https://sgda.io) as livestreamed on Twitch in early May. I kept a dev blog showcasing my progress over the semester which can be read [here]({% link devblog.md %}).

# Glugoo
Glugoo is a single-player 3D action game I created as a solo team for the 2020 Global Game Jam. The player collects items around the world to gain power-ups and overcome various obstacles to reach the goal at the end. I created all aspects of the game myself including the 3D models, code, and level design.

# Equinox: Security Breach
Equinox is a 2v2 assymetric stealth-action shooter I created on a 4-person team over two months in Feb-April 2019 as our final project for the EECS 494 course at UMich. My role was to help design core objectives and abilities for the game as well as creating all 2D and 3D visual assets, doing a little shader scripting, performing UI design, programming certain abilities, and intensive QA testing.

# Sunset Island
A survival horror game I made with a 6-person group in October 2018 for a game jam. Look around the town, collect resources, and watch out for the spiders! On the team I worked as the main 3D asset artist, creating both the 3D models themselves, their 2D textures, and the animations for the NPC and enemy characters.

# ZONE
A single-player 3D puzzle/relaxation game I made solo in January 2018 for the 2018 Global Game Jam. Working alone I designed each of the different levels, created their 3D assets and composed them in Unity, programmed all of the game interactions, and even composed the game's music.
