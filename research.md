# CrowdMask  

![CrowdMask](https://riopelle.me/assets/pics/system_diagram_users.jpg)

I am currently working on a project called "CrowdMask" (or "ObSecure") with Walter Lasecki in the [Crowds and Machines (CROMA) Lab](http://croma.eecs.umich.edu/croma.html) at the University of Michigan. We are researching a system to allow crowd workers to answer questions about an images taken by visually-impaired users without being exposed to private content that may be in those images.  

The approach combines the speed of off-the-shelf object-detection systems such as YOLO with additional crowd workers. In our pipeline these workers can use their contextual human knowledge to decide which of the objects identified are private, while the images remain filtered so that the exact private content is not visible to them either.
