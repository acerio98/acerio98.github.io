Hi! My name's Austin. I am a rising senior at the University of Michigan from Ashburn, Virginia studying computer science with an interest in computer vision and 3D systems. I like exploring the ways machines can be used to generate and interpret visual content in both virtual contexts and the real world.

To research these areas, I have been doing work with Prof. Walter Lasecki at the UMich [CROMA Lab](cromalab.net) that focuses on HCI applications related to crowd-powered techniques and how they can complement ML systems. My current project, CrowdMask, focuses on learning how crowd workers can augment a traditional CV object detector to pick out private content to be masked in images without being exposed to that content themselves.

Also I do work in the game development space, mainly using the Unity engine. I love not only programming games but also designing and creating assets for them, especially in 3D. I am a third-year officer of [Wolverine Soft](wolverinesoft.org) at UMich, currently in the role of treasurer but having also served as webmaster and historian in the past.

In my free time I enjoy playing RPG and sandbox video games, and also feeding my artistic side by practicing 3D modeling, sketching, and photography.
